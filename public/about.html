<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>With a background in Mass Communication and an MBA, I've always been drawn to the ways media and business shape our world.
   Now, I’m pursuing a master’s in Communication with a focus on Digital Media in Europe, which is letting me explore the 
   intersection of policy-making and digital platforms—two areas that I find deeply fascinating. This journey has expanded my
    understanding of how digital media can influence change, and I’m excited to bring together my knowledge from different fields
     to make a meaningful impact.</p>

<p> Outside of my studies, 
  I'm diving into computer science and enjoying the challenges of learning to code. 
  I believe these skills will be invaluable in today’s tech-driven landscape. 
  I’m also someone who loves staying active, whether that’s through working out or taking 
  on new skills to keep growing. This mix of interests keeps me curious,
   motivated, and ready for whatever comes next!!</p>
